# Operating Systems Lab – Experiment 1  
## Basic Linux Commands (Ubuntu)

This experiment demonstrates the practical use of fundamental Linux commands in Ubuntu for file and directory management.

The purpose of this practical is to build a strong foundation in command-line operations, which are essential for understanding Operating Systems, system-level interaction, and real-world Linux environments.

---

## 📌 Concepts Covered

This experiment focuses on essential filesystem operations in Linux, including:

- Viewing the current working directory
- Listing directory contents
- Displaying hidden system files
- Creating new directories
- Navigating between directories
- Creating new files
- Copying files
- Renaming files
- Deleting files

These operations form the core of Linux file and directory management.

## 🧩 Linux Commands Demonstrated

The practical demonstrates the functionality of the following commands:

- `pwd` – Displays the present working directory  
- `ls` – Lists files and directories  
- `ls -a` – Displays all files including hidden files  
- `mkdir` – Creates a new directory  
- `cd` – Changes the current directory  
- `touch` – Creates an empty file  
- `cp` – Copies files from one location to another  
- `mv` – Renames or moves files  
- `rm` – Deletes files permanently  

Each command was executed successfully and verified through terminal output.
