# 🏁 Conclusion

The Operating System Lab provided comprehensive practical exposure to fundamental operating system concepts. Through hands-on experimentation in Ubuntu Linux, various system-level mechanisms such as process scheduling, deadlock avoidance, memory management, and file system operations were implemented and analyzed.

These practical sessions strengthened understanding of how operating systems manage resources, schedule processes, handle memory, and maintain system stability. The integration of Linux command-line operations with C programming enhanced problem-solving abilities and system programming skills.

Overall, the lab successfully bridged theoretical knowledge with real-world system implementation, developing a strong foundation in operating system concepts.
